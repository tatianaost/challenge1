# Task 1: software configuration
Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?

I decided to take part in this challenge because working in IT is my goal and dream for the near future.

My goal is to learn the basics of QA and learn about testing. I also hope to get an internship.
